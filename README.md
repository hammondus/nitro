# Nitro

## Purpose
Does the world need another Web Server.
Clearly the answer is: No....

I wanted a project to improve my Go programming skills, and in the process, create a web server that was:
- small
- performant
- zero config for interal usage
- cross platform. A single binary with no dependencies.
